# EE-151-OpenCV-Smart-Hub

#Hi! This is my final project for EE 151! By uploading Firmata to the arduino, the arduino serial port becomes open to inputs from python programs. This means you can use all the good libraries from python with your arduino, which means openCV + arduino! 


#This is a more simple computer vision project that controls an LED and an LCD display. There are some bugs and weird interactions to still fix up, especially because the DHT sensor is so hard to work with using pyfirmata.
